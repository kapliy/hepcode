split arch:
Run in subregions, but 2nd step (4L) will run ALL subregions.
At 8L stage, we apply in-road HW (HW=1), so no hw is done across subregions!
This means we can safely use 8L tracks from subregions without merging!

So the dataflow is:
64 * 8 grid jobs, each running:
8L fullchain -> 4 sequential 4L jobs (which are fast because so few 8L tracks) -> 4L dummy roadmerger -> 11L tracks in this 8L subregion
(allow DO_NOT_KEEP_ROADS)

Merge job (or jobs, if multiple nfilesperjob blocks)
Loop regions
 Download 64 output files that contain 11L tracks
 Merge tracks (and roads, if kept) - do "as you go" (?)
Final merge of 8 region road / track files; trigftkana stuff

TODO: smart dq2-get: if file is local and on pnfs, use dq2-get -p dcap


njobs and inDS regulate data input.

What do we want to loop?
regs, subs, patternPoints, fileblocks
We never actually need to convert these into njobs format. Except maybe in merge job when we need to download this:-(
