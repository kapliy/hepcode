TrigFTKAna:
Edit asym_common.sh, specify output folder.
Run tarball.sh to tar up the code that will be taken to compute nodes
Run asym_run.sh -> wait ~30 hours for condor jobs to finish.
Go to /share/t3data3/antonk/ana/<NEW_FOLDER>
Run "checklogs" within both pt20 and pt25 subfolders. Make sure there are not errors, except perhaps alpgen wmunu (missing MC).
Go to /atlas/uct3/data/user/antonk/ana/<NEW_FOLDER>
Run "replicate" inside both pt20 and pt25 subfolders

rootfit:
Edit config.sh, update (at the bottom) the path to NEW_FOLDER and supply a new antondb (.db) file version.
Run QCD_3D_submit.sh, wait for condor jobs to finish (<1 hour)   -> creates antondb files containing fit results
Merge 246 *.db files into a master db file:
    ./antondb_merge.py DB_07022014_dinosisoMC.v70.db 'logs/*.db'
Run prepare_qcd.sh  -> makes IN_*.root files via stack2.py
Run ./qcdsys3d.sh   -> makes OUT_*.root files via qcdsys3d.py (combined IN_*.root files with antondb files containing fit results)

EWUnfoldingH:
Go to ~/EWUnfoldingH/Code/Input/ and update config.sh (similar, but not the same format as roofit/config.sh)
Make a copy of unfolding AND OUT*.root files by running update.sh
Go to /home/antonk/EWUnfoldingH/Code and run ./run.sh to run all unfolding scripts
Run systematics smoothing scripts (WmunuSmoothing.py) without and with 'bayes' argument.
Back up output to output.vXY. Back up Results to Results.vXY
Run Plot.C plots: ./wmunu.sh XY
