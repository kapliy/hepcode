TODO note:
Add a couple of W mT fits in the appendix. Note: Adrian uses 40-100 GeV fit range!
DONE Move Double-differential QCD uncertainty plots into the main body.
DONE Update QCD uncertainty plots - use smooth curves, similar to Adrian


DONE de-correlate ttbar from all other ewk uncertainties in qcdsys3d.py
     - make sure these plots don't over-write Nominal!
DONE Total Luminosity: 4579.44 pb-1
DONE Re-run QCD estimate with ewk up/down and top up/down
DONE Increase QCD unc in stack plotting scripts
DONE change avg(up,down) to max(up,down) in stack plotting

APPROVAL(ADRIAN):
Suggestion to come up with an alternative method for QCD systematic
worries about background "composition uncertainty"
* W+jets cannot be taken from MC
Muon pt spectrum break at 50 GeV - not seen in Wenu or Zee!

* TODO: per-period cross-section splitting. Maybe substitute with per-run signal yield plot?
* TODO: Max: matrix method QCD in wmunu

NOTE:
DONE Add RecoStatUp/RecoStatDown histograms so they can be added to the band
DONE Add QCD 1d vs 2d summary to appendix
Max: MET fit before MET cut (play with unbinned ntuples, or use anyfit)
Max: make pt plots with W pt rw target ONLY.
DONE: Debug anyfit R__unzip bug. (using smartkiller)

APPROVAL:
DONE Trigger efficiency - problem at high pT. Compare with old trigger!
MAX: Isolation SFs: study sagging
BG summary slide: separate QCD uncorrelated and correlated uncertainty
SKIP: Switch to bayesian unfolding by default


DONE Make delta-Phi plots between softterms and other met components
DONE Max: re-run with new phi trigger SF's.
DONE Change qcd summary table to: delQCD / QCD

DOING: Muon reco SF - compare with Max's instructions.
DOING: MET-scale: check that up/down is not switched.

DONE Add some more words in supporting document about the curvature parametrization.
DONE Check the direction of Up variation is different with/without QCD (since it's different with Wenu)

TODO: check wmunu/wenu channel merging
DONE dump all muon-related scale factors (by Max)

DONE Data reweighting of the distribution we unfold

TABLES:
DONE QCD uncertainties in table form
TODO Plot QCD chi2/ndf for different systematics

DONE: CHECK if muon reco corrections correct in phi - NO

QCD FITS:
LONG overdue: really need to understand difference in bgqcd=3 and bgqcd=4.
Plot normalized templates on top of each other?

OCT29:
* Look at MCP systematics by-hand: is statistical uncertainty dominant? If not, can we reduce it by averaging?
MCP corrections: is most of uncertainty statistical? Then no point messing with the systematics!
MCP corrections: split in phi bins, for the barrel case where there is large C offset?

Peter: why w mt is best.
it factors out w pt. Overlay templates for different generators - expect better agreement between them in w_mt (vs other variables).

Consider EtMissRel instead of etmiss?
/home/antonk/ElectroweakBosons/AnalysisZmumu/HFrame/src

MET propagation: see if KC corrections are actually valid for low-pt muons, which are used for MET propagation!

charge mis-id - won't work from Z's. Flip probability. Can't look at same-sign Z's

MCP:
* understand systematics using special MC. Validate the method by putting a shift by hand. Massimo will make samples
effect on the order of 0.2 TeV-1.
KS toy-MC study (performing a fit) - see if errors are correct. If yes, drop chi2 method.
Peter: does z resolution improve in data following the correction?
TODO: Z mass fit in bins of eta/phi - including on MC (confirm Kluit's problem)
      Z mass peak fit with alpgen; fit with/without pileup factors.
      Z mass peak at particle level (which is, however, after FSR/ISR)
Suggestions for MCP:
* Add fitted-z-mass in phi/eta bins plot!
  https://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?subContId=3&contribId=7&resId=1&materialId=slides&confId=157170
* Add p_cmb-p_ID feature
  https://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?subContId=0&contribId=7&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=157170
print keysfit id/exms string modification to make sure it is correct.
* Et-miss resolution study: use Z events; project on Z pt axis (Sam Whitehead's thesis)
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!
MCP scales:
* Check if RooKeysPDF rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
