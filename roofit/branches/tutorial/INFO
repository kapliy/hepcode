root_all.root, root_all_v1.root
Flatntupler release 16 (athena version 15) - first results.
This had been verified with cutflows long time ago (via python version of analysis code)
About 10k Z events in total.
This (_v1 version) was used for my 03/01 MCP talk

scales_03012011.root
Changing scales for mu+ and mu- to test sqrt(k+*k-) assumption

root_all_v19.root -> root_all_0311.root
First version of v19 (athena release 16) processing.
Cuts marginally copied from Jordan for jets and muon quality - cutflow not verified yet.

root_all_0323.root
Added private muon reprocessed with geometry resembling 2011 data

root_all_0328.root
After large updates by Antonio, including changes to definition of is_staco_combined.
First attempt to use a TNtuple (in addition to TGraph, for now)
Verified that compatible with 0311. Also processing reprocess-2010 and early 2011 (two runs)
(missing mc10a).
This was used for my 03/30 MCP talk

root_all_0331.root
Update after talking to Peter:
* changed z0 to zb for muon-z0 - vertex cut (reverted in a later iteration to preserve evt counts!)
* removed muon MS and MS-ID matching cuts in release 16 analysis
* Only saving ntuples now, also saving ID,MS,EXMS separately (note that Z selection is still based on MS!)
After a few updates (root file was remade), this was made in April 01 - April 15 talks, done by Peter)

root_all_0312graph.root
root_all_0312msid.root
This is trying to reproduce old numbers
Results in Peter email - multiple effects contirbute a little.
Difference between graph and ntuple due to mz window narrowing to 70..100 GeV

root_apr13.root
Peter asked to verify 2011 data problems in MS (C-side endcap).
What's done here: graph of (ptms-ptid)/pt vs eta

root_data2011_0425.root
Added 2011 data up to period D3. Note that periodB and periodD are NOT compatible - repro07 and repro08.
Reran old-2011 version, but with 25 GeV cut.

root_data2011_0426.root
Save as above, but running 2011 data with correct GRL. Separately period B (pro07) and D1-D3 (pro08).

root_0505_closure.root
Major version - final scales for the first note on 2010 data. This also includes closure tests on 2010 and 2011 data!
(closure tests are wrong - they use "old" scales, not final scales, and they were applied to data, not MC).

root_all_0516_2010clos.root
An update - checking closure using the "proper" method of applying to MC!
