root_all.root, root_all_v1.root
Flatntupler release 16 (athena version 15) - first results.
This had been verified with cutflows long time ago (via python version of analysis code)
About 10k Z events in total.
This (_v1 version) was used for my 03/01 MCP talk

scales_03012011.root
Changing scales for mu+ and mu- to test sqrt(k+*k-) assumption

root_all_v19.root -> root_all_0311.root
First version of v19 (athena release 16) processing.
Cuts marginally copied from Jordan for jets and muon quality - cutflow not verified yet.

root_all_0323.root
Added private muon reprocessed with geometry resembling 2011 data

root_all_0328.root
After large updates by Antonio, including changes to definition of is_staco_combined.
First attempt to use a TNtuple (in addition to TGraph, for now)
Verified that compatible with 0311. Also processing reprocess-2010 and early 2011 (two runs)
(missing mc10a).
This was used for my 03/30 MCP talk

root_all_0331.root
Update after talking to Peter:
* changed z0 to zb for muon-z0 - vertex cut.
* removed muon MS and MS-ID matching cuts in release 16 analysis
* Only saving ntuples now, also saving ID,MS,EXMS separately (note that Z selection is still based on MS!)
