TODO: (look into efficiency calculation and why histograms turn negative!)

conversion to truth level. Resolution is not negligible in MET. unfolding.
Peter: METRefFinal - METTruth; split into parallel and perpendicular to lepton axis components (later)
Handle bad charge-dependent modeling - even though QCD is fit in a charge-dependent fasion.


Issues:
* choose generator that models missing et best (!!!)
* alternate higher order generators for w production - ? powheg? Read about generators!

Suggestions for analysis:
* z0/d0 vs nvtx plots
* charge mis-id plots
* z tag-probe vs muon p (not pt)
* add yields


Suggestions for MCP:
* Add fitted-z-mass in phi/eta bins plot!

* Add p_cmb-p_ID feature
  https://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?subContId=0&contribId=7&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=157170
* Do Peter-style W analysis (should be easy, given what i have!)


print keysfit id/exms string modification to make sure it is correct.
* Add data-driven QCD template capability to SuData

Analysis updates:
* trigger matching (HiggsWW example)
* trigger scaling (following matching)
* jet-muon overlap
* only consider vtx[0] for vertex finding
* alpgen HFOR tool


* Check POWHEG+pythia asymmetry in last bin - compared with MC@NLO+HERWIG
* Et-miss resolution study: use Z events; project on Z pt axis (Sam Whitehead's thesis)

Consider W+jets QCD templates
MCP hits that fail - vs eta/phi in 2d (suspect specific modules)!

Muon scales:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* !!! Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level. Add to wasym definitions
* !!! Start using mutag muons

* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!

ANALYSIS:
* Check if RooKeysPDF rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
