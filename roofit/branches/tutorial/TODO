Debug charge: q_id and q_exms have -2 sometimes. Also, seems unfilled in peter ntuple!

Results of meeting:
TODO: try without psMS - ptID cut
pt cone 0.2 / pt < 0.1
Peter: et isolation problem; do pileup reweighting

TAG-PROBE
* Fork stack.py to provide tag-and-probe functionality

Immediate:
* Update xsections
* Write script RUN_PLOTS.sh to run multiple ntuple plots
  Include QCD region, anti-d0 selection, etc (add to ntuple)
* Add to antondb ability to save exact command used to run it

Muon scales:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level

Jordan cutflow:
* Rip QCD fit from Jordan

* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!

ANALYSIS:
* Muon QCD template: events failing d0
  MET fix (0..100) with qcd and w+jets floating

TODO
Differences from F. Cerutti:
* HE: |delta-z0| < 5 mm
* HE: ptid, ptexms > 10 GeV
* HE: ptcb > 10 GeV (we use > 20 GeV)
* TODO: fit egge convolved with simple gaussian; range = 80..100;

* Check if rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
