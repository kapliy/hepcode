June 29:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* Reorganize folders in root file: shapes in one subfolder!
* IMPORTANT: Write code to convert dg to latex code; also to html (with picture conversion)

Special cases:
* Fix R0 bug: in high statistics, chi2 fit range is too wide in BB
* FWA: chi2 and ks too different - why?? Try different smoothing parameters

Data/MC:
* see if wmin/wplus MC@NLO works better if mc weight is excluded
* use jordan's xsection numbers and samples
  Add ability to look for a differently-named folder (not 'dg')


* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* Think if we are doing the wrong thing in R0 scan by cutting around the edges, and THEN applying a scale
  We should first apply the scale to an array and THEN put it into a roodataset - but that's what we do, no?

Peter:
* Add KS feature to dgplot


* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!
* Change eta bound to 1.95 - for later!
Make Z fits with gaus res; feed back scales into code.

TODO
Differences from F. Cerutti:
* HE: |delta-z0| < 5 mm
* HE: ptid, ptexms > 10 GeV
* HE: ptcb > 10 GeV (we use > 20 GeV)
* TODO: fit egge convolved with simple gaussian; range = 80..100;
* TODO: add |eta|<1.7 region!

MC: r2230
Study new MC for systematics!!!
* Add eta sum
Add relative et cone 0.2 < 1.5
* change binning 1.7 - 2.0; 2.0 - 2.4 OR 1.7 - 2.4


Code:
* Enable zmumu tag and probe studies: trigger and reconstruction efficiency

Check if rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
Check error variation due to binning.


*regions: 1.05-1.7, 1.7-2.0, 2.0-2.5, 1.7-2.5 integrated
* Z template mass fit from MC
* Try to fit 1/pt spectrum to a functional form -> single integrated fit.

* zpeak.py:
** Verify consistency. Can use ID as a cross-check since it has largest deviations!
* Introduce 2% inefficiency for mu+, linear with pt - see if MC still works fine.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap


expand range for better QCD estimate (60..100 GeV, or higher)
use new function from Peter
