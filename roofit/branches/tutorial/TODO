Pilcher meeting:
* MC muon smearing systematic; data muon scaling systematic.
* Change of asymmetry for different +/- X% cuts; for different fraction of QCD - using the ntupled version.
* Apply/not apply efficiency and/or trigger scale factors


print keysfit id/exms string modification to make sure it is correct.
simultaneous loading of w and z ntuples doesn't quite work yet - fixme!

* Add data-driven QCD template capability to SuData
Apply MET scales. Verify they actually work (print scaling correcting factor out)

Analysis updates:
* trigger matching (HiggsWW example)
* trigger scaling (following matching)
* jet-muon overlap
* only consider vtx[0] for vertex finding
* alpgen HFOR tool

Peter:
do things break down as a function of njets?

* Check POWHEG+pythia asymmetry in last bin - compared with MC@NLO+HERWIG
* Et-miss resolution study: use Z events; project on Z pt axis (Sam Whitehead's thesis)

Consider W+jets QCD templates
MCP hits that fail - vs eta/phi in 2d (suspect specific modules)!

Muon scales:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* !!! Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level. Add to wasym definitions
* !!! Start using mutag muons

* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!

ANALYSIS:
* Check if RooKeysPDF rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
