* update db_* executable to do systematics and print in latex

Muon scales:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* IMPORTANT: Write code to convert dg to latex code; also to html (with picture conversion)
* Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level

Jordan cutflow:
* Rip QCD fit from Jordan

* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!


TODO
Differences from F. Cerutti:
* HE: |delta-z0| < 5 mm
* HE: ptid, ptexms > 10 GeV
* HE: ptcb > 10 GeV (we use > 20 GeV)
* TODO: fit egge convolved with simple gaussian; range = 80..100;

* Check if rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
