Code:
* Enable zmumu tag and probe studies: trigger and reconstruction efficiency

Check if rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
Check error variation due to binning.



*regions: 1.05-1.7, 1.7-2.0, 2.0-2.5, 1.7-2.5 integrated
* Z template mass fit from MC
* Try to fit 1/pt spectrum to a functional form -> single integrated fit.

* zpeak.py:
** Verify consistency. Can use ID as a cross-check since it has largest deviations!
* Introduce 2% inefficiency for mu+, linear with pt - see if MC still works fine.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap


expand range for better QCD estimate (60..100 GeV, or higher)
use new function from Peter
