TODO:
* add et plot; consider effects of pileup
* Ask root to do binomial errors: use long form of divide (option "B")
* fix MCP hits requirements - weird bugs (??)
Peter: shape of abs isolation is funny
MCP hits that fail - vs eta/phi in 2d (suspect specific modules)!
* Rip QCD fit from Jordan
* Update tag-probe code to also plot Z's and perform BG subtraction, if requested!
* check that we don't get multiple entries per event in tag-probe study!

Results of meeting:
DONE: try without psMS - ptID cut
DONE: pt cone 0.2 / pt < 0.1
Peter: et isolation problem; do pileup reweighting

Muon scales:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* !!! Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level. Add to wasym definitions
* !!! Start using mutag muons



* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!

ANALYSIS:
* Muon QCD template: events failing d0
  MET fix (0..100) with qcd and w+jets floating

* Check if RooKeysPDF rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
