June 29:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* IMPORTANT: Write code to convert dg to latex code; also to html (with picture conversion)
* Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level

Special cases:
* Fix R0 bug: in high statistics, chi2 fit range is too wide in BB
* FWA: chi2 and ks too different - why?? Try different smoothing parameters

Jordan cutflow:
* Rip QCD fit from Jordan
* Apply pt>25 GeV cut on muons, as Jordan does.


* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!

TrigFTKAna:
* Add charge separation in StudyWCrossSectionCandidate::_study by dg::down into POS and NEG folders automatically

TODO
Differences from F. Cerutti:
* HE: |delta-z0| < 5 mm
* HE: ptid, ptexms > 10 GeV
* HE: ptcb > 10 GeV (we use > 20 GeV)
* TODO: fit egge convolved with simple gaussian; range = 80..100;

* Check if rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
