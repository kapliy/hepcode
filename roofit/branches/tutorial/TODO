Analysis updates:
* trigger matching (HiggsWW example)
* trigger scaling (following matching)
* jet-muon overlap
* only consider vtx[0] for vertex finding
* do we use em-scale jets for met cleaning?
* alpgen HFOR tool

Peter:
apply pythia-based acceptance correction to alpgen samples.
do things break down as a function of njets?
Write down exactly what am i measuring.


* Check POWHEG+pythia asymmetry in last bin - compared with MC@NLO+HERWIG
* Et-miss resolution study: use Z events; project on Z pt axis (Sam Whitehead's thesis)
* Try to see if low-mass tail in Mll goes away if cuts are always applied to combined muons
* Add data-driven QCD template capability to SuData

Apply MET scales. Verify they actually work (print scaling correcting factor out)
Consider W+jets QCD templates

TODO:
* fix MCP hits requirements - weird bugs (??)
* Add a version of histo creation using temp in-memory tree - to remove multiple candidates per event
   check that we don't get multiple entries per event in tag-probe study!
* Employ effFast (TEfficiency) in the tag-and-probe calculation
Peter: shape of abs isolation is funny
MCP hits that fail - vs eta/phi in 2d (suspect specific modules)!


Results of meeting:
DONE: try without psMS - ptID cut
DONE: pt cone 0.2 / pt < 0.1
Peter: et isolation problem; do pileup reweighting

Muon scales:
* Investigate RooEggePdf - see if it is indeed compatible with my implementation!
  Test by fitting the same event!
* Add to template the CDF plot before and after either chi2 or ks
* !!! Relax eta to 2.5 - apply at plot level. Add to wasym definitions
* !!! Start using mutag muons


* Applying absolute scale: perhaps going about it the wrong way? Use the KS statistic between data and MC
  to find the location of the peak?
* in zpeak.py: automatically apply defaults depending on region and type of muon!

ANALYSIS:
* Muon QCD template: events failing d0
  MET fix (0..100) with qcd and w+jets floating

* Check if RooKeysPDF rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap
