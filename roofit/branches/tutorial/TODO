* Adaptive kernel
* Z template mass fit from MC

* zpeak.py:
** Verify consistency. Can use ID as a cross-check since it has largest deviations!
* Introduce 2% inefficiency for mu+, linear with pt - see if MC still works fine.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap


expand range for better QCD estimate (60..100 GeV, or higher)
use new function from Peter
