* Change eta bound to 1.95 - for later!


* Add paragraph about z fit: both gaussian and full lineshape. Say full lineshape 
* Add table with z central values in data and MC and error in data
* Study independently the effect of Z window on gaussian fit.

* Get degree of variation within smaller eta bins via KLU method only


Make Z fits with gaus res; feed back scales into code.

Systematic effects from MC:
Update ngroups to plot mean/error in TErrorGraph and print on label fitted mean and maximum spread
- repeat for several values of statistics, for KLU and non-KLU

Add simple-mean version for 1/pt spectra (i.e. what everybody else is doing)
Save in rtxt?

For tomorrow:
Given event counts in 2010, study stat variation in MC.
Study variation with chi2 binning



TODO
Differences from F. Cerutti:
* HE: |delta-z0| < 5 mm
* HE: ptid, ptexms > 10 GeV
* HE: ptcb > 10 GeV (we use > 20 GeV)
* TODO: fit egge convolved with simple gaussian; range = 80..100;
* TODO: add |eta|<1.7 region!

MC: r2230
Study new MC for systematics!!!
* Add eta sum
Add relative et cone 0.2 < 1.5
* change binning 1.7 - 2.0; 2.0 - 2.4 OR 1.7 - 2.4



Code:
* Enable zmumu tag and probe studies: trigger and reconstruction efficiency

Check if rho can be chosen smartly - Jahred's thesis.
Check error variation due to binning.



*regions: 1.05-1.7, 1.7-2.0, 2.0-2.5, 1.7-2.5 integrated
* Z template mass fit from MC
* Try to fit 1/pt spectrum to a functional form -> single integrated fit.

* zpeak.py:
** Verify consistency. Can use ID as a cross-check since it has largest deviations!
* Introduce 2% inefficiency for mu+, linear with pt - see if MC still works fine.
* Repeat a study to verify sqrt(A*B) works if one leg in barrel, another in endcap


expand range for better QCD estimate (60..100 GeV, or higher)
use new function from Peter
