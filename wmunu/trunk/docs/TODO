* Make a TTree with all PREANA data: charge, 4vector, run, event, lb
* new cutflow + merging in stack.py
* pbs splitter and joiner: make simple script that Adds all histograms and adds dataflow numbers.
* check out template fitting method. Use it to estimate the background. Check TFractionFitter vs template fitting.

* Wrap pile-up QCD samples
* Wrap MC processes with other PDFs and generators - to compare!
* Wrap the minbias samples and check muon trigger efficiency for RPC and TGC! -> make 2d trigger efficiency maps wrt staco.
* check the event filtering script on ESDs (in bookmarks)

* analysis:
njets with a pt cut; pileup samples; add sumet (if present in the ntuple)

post-processing python script:
Specify out.root files and xsections, plus integrated lumi for data.
ls histogram, then plotall - scales MC histos to integrated lumi.

Code grid-processing (run on ALL output at once): should be easy with prun - just need to add a script.


Beamspot: mean and width distributions; variations with run.

Make reco efficiency wrt triggered muons plots!
Add phi plots, too!

Switch to MET_Topo!

* Plot zmumu peak (even when running on Ws)
 * Plot number of muons/Ws etc per event

* charge misidentification (compare to truth!) - versus eta,pt
 * from Z->mumu (data-driven). Also used to measure efficiency.

* Z->mumu background: small but may be asymmetric for mu+ and mu- !
  * see effect of explicit Z cut!
