Mel:
assymmetry + 1 stuff jet - gluons contribution rather than jet.
* electron: very old, sophisticated, PDFs info extraction, many people. oxford - student to student
* muon: many fewer ppl - us and harvard. neither gotten far. focus on early data, get it out into a paper strategy.
  (rather than long term systematics dominated analysis)
  Mel: 10pb start worrying about systematics. Further on, even more focus on statistics, extracting some PDF distributions.
    how are things near term vs middle term?
 Peter: beginning = two bins in eta; later - additional bins
 200 pb, 10 fb paper sequences. but first one may bleed into the second one if 200pb is delayed.
Peter: Z's deficiency prevents development of tools. we really need Zs early on.

* Isolation requirements: use of track isolation for muons. We can work on it.
* Missing ET - recompute with consistent muon; Z rejection; normalization of QCD.

Idea: come up with things to do and share responsibility with Harvard group.
We can focus on calo and ID issues (including isolation)
Need to discuss end product: what are the thesis? Need to be slightly different.

PETER PROPOSAL:
Harvard: short term, stat dominated. Verena is ending 5th year.
Us: long term, tag and probe with Z to understand efficiencies etc
Mel talks to Joal, makes list of priorities.

FIND interesting event with a 35 GeV muon. Set up event display: other tracks with the same z0?
