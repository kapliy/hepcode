Hello,

I produced two GRLs which use the frozen April10-reprocessing flags for
the 152166-153200 period, and the Tier0-pass1 flags for runs 153565,
requiring the calorimeters to be green (first period) or at least yellow
(second period), in addition to the requirement that muons are good. They
are in the attachment. I think that they contain minimal, sensible
requirements for a W/Z analysis, and I'd propose them for use in the W/Z
observation. Best,

Alberto
